# Adaptive Strategy Surface Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines a methodology for analyzing the evolution of trading strategy performance surfaces over time to detect stability, predictability, and regime shifts. By tracking entire performance landscapes (e.g., Sharpe ratios) over parameter grids instead of single optimal values, we can gain insight into how the efficacy of parameter combinations changes and potentially forecast optimal parameters.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Gather Historical Data

- Collect high-resolution OHLCV data (plus optional features like volatility, volume, etc.).
- Ensure coverage of multiple market regimes (bull, bear, volatile, sideways).

### 2. Split Data Into Time Bins

- Choose fixed-length time bins (e.g., 1-year, rolling or non-overlapping).
- Each bin should contain enough data to meaningfully backtest across parameter space.

### 3. Run Backtests Across Parameter Space

- Define a grid of parameters (e.g., `EMA_fast` = [5, 10, ..., 30], `EMA_slow` = [20, 30, ..., 100]).
- For each parameter combination in the grid, run a full backtest and compute a performance metric (e.g., Sharpe, Sortino, CAGR).

**Result per time bin:**

- A performance surface (e.g., 2D array) representing strategy effectiveness across parameter space.

### 4. Vectorize the Performance Surfaces

- Flatten each N-dimensional performance surface into a 1D vector.

```python
vector_t = performance_surface_t.flatten()
```

- Stack all vectors to form a matrix `V` of shape `(T, P)` where:
  - `T` = number of time bins
  - `P` = number of grid points (parameter combinations)

### 5. Compute Correlations Across Time

- **Local correlation** (between adjacent bins):

```python
pearsonr(vector_t, vector_{t+1})
spearmanr(vector_t, vector_{t+1})
```

- **Global correlation matrix**:

```python
cor_matrix = np.corrcoef(V)
```

- Use Pearson for shape similarity; Spearman for rank structure.

### 6. Analyze and Forecast Trends

- High correlation suggests regime stability.
- Gradual drift in parameter optima may be extrapolated.
- Cluster recurring structures to detect repeating regimes.

**Optional forecasting targets:**

- Next period's optimal parameter region
- Entire performance surface shape (using PCA, RNN, etc.)

## Optional Enhancements

| Technique            | Purpose                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Gaussian smoothing   | Reduce noise in performance surfaces |
| Ridge tracking       | Identify persistent optimal regions  |
| Surface entropy      | Measure confidence / uncertainty     |
| PCA/t-SNE on vectors | Visualize evolution of surfaces      |
| Regime clustering    | Identify recurring market conditions |

## Applications

- Forecast optimal strategy parameters adaptively
- Quantify risk of regime shift
- Construct ensemble or blended strategies
- Build meta-models that predict landscape evolution

## Conclusion

By modeling the full performance surface instead of static optimal parameters, we gain a richer understanding of strategy robustness and adaptability. This approach helps bridge the gap between traditional backtesting and true adaptive algorithmic trading.
